# Introduction
I wrote this Caro game the first time in 2013 with code-behind technical as common.
4 years later (2017), the second version was released with MVVM pattern.

## Tech stack
- C#
- .NET5
- WPF
- MVVM
- Minimax algorithm, with alpha-beta prunning

## Intention for near future
- Change UI to English totally
- Migrate to .NET6 (since most developers aren't still using VS2022 so far, so it's good to end with .NET5 at this time)
